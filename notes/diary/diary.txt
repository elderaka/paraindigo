I don't know, to whoever read this, I'm sorry karena ini cuman isi keluh kesah doang selama ngeprogram ini
dan gw baru mulai sekarang karena bener2 unbearable. Well, I really don't know. Lagi dapet block banget
Is it worth it? Everything that I made? Because, I really took too much effort only for this one. I really
F*cking hell, I just don't know how should I describe it. But, making everything from the scratch is really hard
Dan deadline tinggal beberapa hari lagi. Sementara tiap hari didepan laptop buat nyari ide2 yang bagus
ngeprogram ginian itu gak gampang. Apalagi nembak2nya. Bener2 mesti kalkulasi semuanya.
Direction? i*360/totalammo. 
Mau muter? i*360/totalammo + angle_a
Mau naikin jadi lingkaran? x + jari*cos(derajat*pi/2), y + jari*sin(derajat*pi/2)
etc
Belom lagi nyari teori2 mtk. Apalagi golden ratio.
gw kira bikin pattern kek bunga, bola, etc itu emg bagus. tapi pengaplikasiannya yang susah
man, ini juga masih my first time programming like this. But I really hope that this is worth it.
I'm not really sure that using this note as my ranting media is good or not
From now on, I'll add the timestamp

23:00 WITA
I really need help. Not programming help, but mental health.
I've been totally awake in front of computer 14 hours a day doing this kind of stuff
All completely alone from the scratch
So I don't really know
what would happened
if
i
failed
this one
I really
fucking
need
help
i don't even have anyone. no one helped me
no one motivated me
i can't motivate myself
i don't even know if this is worth it or not
i poured my soul and heart for this one project
and i hope this one wouldn't be my last
I'm really sorry to whoever read my useless rant

23:56 WITA
my only friend is piano music such as Haruka Nakamura, Tomoya Naka, Yirumah, etc
It helped me with my imagination

Should I include Ada Cherubim?
i dunno. I already drained most of my sanity. I'll decide it

49 TRIES AND NONE ARE GOOD
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST FEELS LIKE
autism energy

i'm not in the spectrum, aren't I?
