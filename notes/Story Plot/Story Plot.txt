"Everything came into my prediction" Ada said while laughing like a maniac.
She already saw it coming. She monitored [The A] movement through her own will.
Being one of [The A] reincarnation is enough for her to stay connected with them.
It was 100% [The A] fault. They really thought that trying to took over a [Creationist] body is a good idea.
the [Creationist] were never that great of a person. Not even Pleiades Rai, or as known as Saint Pandora
Unlike Pandora that played on [The A] sandbox as [Overseer of Reality], Ada also tried to infiltrate 0-0-0
timeline by going with name of [Overlord of Art].
She even sacrificed most of her plate only because she's trying to fit in with the other [Rulers].
Such as Pandora as Zero winged [Ruler of Sanity]
Garda as Two winged [Ruler of Animus and Anima]
Surra Kattar as Four winged [Ruler of Figure]
Persalius as Six winged [Ruler of Sentient]
Aliyu as Eight winged [Ruler of Soul]
Dramentalis as Ten winged [Ruler of Mortal]
and finally Ada as Twelve winged [Ruler of Art]
For [Creationist], their plates means how verse they are at creating universes. Their plates can grow exponentially
However, it's hard for one to create more than 4 plates, yet 12 of them.
But Pandora is an exception. It seems like he has almost infinite plates. At one glance, it's seems like he
had two set of halo on his back. However, if you try to compare it with another [Creationist], it's become clear
that it's in fact not his second set of halo.
But it was infinite series of plates that perfectly create a circle on his back.
It's unclear if it's a glitch in matrix, or Pandora indeed has infinite potential as being a [Creationist]
One thing that's sure is that he's becoming both [Lawyer] and [Ruler]
And both of them also known as one of the most important aspect on every universe
It's kind of like Aliyu after his father death. But Pandora didn't merge his title like Aliyu.
That's why he's known as [Overseer of Reality] and also [Overlord of Sanity].
Unlike Aliyu that has potential of becoming [Overseer of Space] and [Overlord of Soul].
The reason is because she's unsure should she keep the name Eros Rai, or use her birth name of Savant Satella.
And her decision is that she split the title with Haru due to their lineage.
Haru as Haru Satella Clement, [Terra-Harmonia Rai: Overseer of Time]
Aliyu as Aliyu Savant Satella, [Eros-Anteros Rai: Overseer of Space and Soul]
While it's not really possible to merge two Rai title at once, for some rare occurence it's possible.
One of the most famous example of this is the late Antares Rai holder, Sarion Kirishima.
She's supposed to hold two Rai title at once. From the former [Overseer of Matter] holder, Orion Rai
and for her own title, Antares Rai.
Because of that, she respected Orion and changed her real name from Saria to Sarion so that she can abuse the loophole.
The same also happened to both Indigo from 0-0-0, Haru and Aliyu
Haru become Terra-Harmonia Rai after he received Alice's [Erudera's Factor] just before she died.
And Aliyu also received Devan's [Philosophical Factor] alongside Devan's scythe to mark her as the new [Overseer of Time and Space]
Back to Haru, that makes him holds two [Erudera's Factor]. 
[Erudera's Factor] is an extremely rare factor that can be indicated by a person's Indigo Aura that's enveloping their body.
and it's factor is extremely favored by the universe, even more than the [Philosophical Factor] and [Psychological Factor]
it's as if they became the main character of the universe just as the moment they hold those factor.
And known [Erudera's Factor] among universes are:
Haru Clement, Sora Claire, Aliyu Claire, Aura Myst, Petra Tet, Alice Tet, Elijah Manazora, Anulot Kirishima, Betelgeuse Rai, Raya Adreamsky, Jibril Xavierus,
Isagel Harttman, and Elio Tet.
Everyone know about the presence of Indigo Aura. But only few people know about the presence of [Erudera's Factor]
And that person includes Ada Cherubim.
She's also the indirect reason why Persalius tried to kidnap the Indigo on arc 1.
and also she's the one who persuade the late [Phobos Rai:Overseer of Infinite] to attain true Infinite.
Knowing that [The A] would interfere and demand an Indigo as the last sacrifice.
and lastly, she's also the one who ordered Eros Rai to commit Tetrahedrolion genocide in order to fish out Elio Tet.
But of course all of them failed.
However
Now she realized
about the being
even2
stronger
than
[The A]
And she's on her way
to attain [Erudera's Factor] from Isagel Harttman
